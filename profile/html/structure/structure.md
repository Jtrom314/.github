# HTML structure elements

The two major purposes of HTML is to provide structure and content to your web application. Some of the common HTML structural elements include `body`, `header`, `footer`, `main`, `section` `aside`, `p`, `table`, `ol/ul`, `div`, and `span`. We demonstrate the use of each element with the following HTML document. It starts with the top level content `body`. The body has three children, a `header`, `main`, and `footer`. Each of the body children then contains other structural content.

The `header` contains a `p`aragraph with a `span`, and a `nav`igation containing multiple `div`isions of sub-content.

The `main` contains multiple `section`s that contain either an unordered list (`ul`) or a `table`. Main also contains an `aside` for content that does not fit the content flow of the sections.

The `footer` has a content division with a single span.

```html
<body>
  <p>Body</p>
  <header>
    <p>Header - <span>Span</span></p>
    <nav>
      Navigation
      <div>Div</div>
      <div>Div</div>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <p>Section</p>
      <ul>
        <li>List</li>
        <li>List</li>
        <li>List</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>Section</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Table</th>
          <th>Table</th>
          <th>Table</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>table</td>
          <td>table</td>
          <td>table</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </section>
    <aside>
      <p>Aside</p>
    </aside>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <div>Footer - <span>Span</span></div>
  </footer>
</body>
```

If we rendered this HTML, and added just a bit of styling, so we can see how they related to each other, we would see the following.

Properly representing the page structure using the elements is important not only so it makes logical sense to a programmer, but also so that automated tools like search indexing crawlers and accessibility screen readers can correctly interpret the document.

## Block and inline

There is a distinction between structure elements that are block vs inline. A block element is meant to be a distinct block in the flow of the content structure. An inline element is meant to be inline with the content flow of a block element. In other words, inline elements do not disrupt the flow of a block element's content. For example, the block element `div` (division) could have an inline element `b` in order to bring attention to a portion of its sub-text. Likewise a `p` (paragraph) element could have a `span` to mark the paragraph's sub-text as a person's name.

```html
<div>He said <b>don't</b> cross the beams.</div>

<p>
  Authors such as <span>Lee cummings</span> often used unconventional structure.
</p>
```
